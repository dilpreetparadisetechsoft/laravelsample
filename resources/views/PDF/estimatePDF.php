         <p  style="line-height:1.7;"><i>“Arrived home to a flood in my basement. I called Canada Restoration Services, and within minutes was speaking with Paul Quirouette ( Branch Manager ). Paul arrived at our rural location within 40 minutes. He quickly assessed the situation and put us at ease. I must say that I have never met someone with so much knowledge and customer service skills. Paul and his team are professionals, and I highly recommend them. I wish I would have called him 6 years ago when we experienced a similar situation!”</i></p>

         <h4 style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;"><i>“Asbestos Removal”</i></h4>
         <p><i>“We discovered a mold issue in our house and were very frustrated with the untimely responses and lack of attention from the initial restoration company we consulted with. On Thanksgiving Monday, we called Canada&#39;s Restoration Services. Less than 45 minutes later, Jorge called us back, immediately decreased our fears, answered our questions with so much detail and patience, told us what to do until we could see him and scheduled an appointment. Since that day, Jorge and his team which included Jacob, Russel and James have provided fabulous service, answered our questions in a prompt manner, always responded to our emails or texts about the work and have been on time for every appointment. They&#39;ve never rushed us in any conversation and are thorough, thoughtful and very helpful in responses. They are extremely professional, hard working and friendly. Jorge has recommended excellent contacts for our interior and exterior rebuilding. Even though, his work is done, Jorge continues to follow up, provide recommendations and resources and is making sure the job is getting done completely to our satisfaction. We feel very fortunate to have met Jorge, Jacob, James and Russel and would highly recommend them to anyone requiring restorations services.”</i></p>

         <h4 style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;"><i>“Mold Removal and Reconstruction”</i></h4>
         <p><i>“I am very impressed with this company! I had a bathroom leak resulting in mold in my kitchen ceiling. I received a call back from Aris within 45 minutes of calling the company, and he was out to inspect the problem the next day. He was able to have his remediation crew come in a few days later. Once the remediation process was complete and the plumbing leak fixed, his construction crew was right back in to repair my bathroom floor, replace my kitchen ceiling, and paint. All of their staff were professional and hardworking, and their work was perfect. Aris was also out the day after the work was completed to inspect the job and to make sure that I was satisfied. I would certainly use this company again, and recommend them to my friends.”</i></p>
